Iris flower classification is a well-known machine learning problem that classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
The Iris dataset, containing 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), serves as the basis for this task. 
The classification process involves several steps: data exploration and visualization to understand feature relationships, data preprocessing to handle missing 
values and normalize features, and model selection from various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

After selecting and training the model using a split of training and testing data, model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, 
and confusion matrix. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model, followed by deployment for predicting the species of new iris flowers. 
The Iris dataset's simplicity and well-defined structure make it ideal for beginners to learn and practice machine learning concepts. 
The classification task demonstrates the entire workflow of a machine learning project, from data handling to model evaluation and tuning.
